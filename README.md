## CRISP-DM Methodology

CRISP-DM is like our roadmap for exploring and understanding data. It breaks down complex data projects into manageable steps, starting from understanding what the business needs are, all the way to deploying our solutions. It's super helpful because it keeps us organized and ensures we're on track with our goals. Plus, it's not just for one specific industry, so we can apply it to all sorts of projects, which is awesome for learning and building our skills. It's basically our guide to navigating the world of data mining!

### **Introduction**
<p>Finding new customers is vital in every industry. The process for finding new customers begins by learning as much as possible from the existing customers. Understanding current customers allow organizations to identify groups of customers that have different product interests, different market participation, or different response to marketing efforts. Market segmentation, the process of identifying customers’ groups, makes use of geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral characteristics of customers. By understanding the differences between the different segments, organizations can make better strategic choices about opportunities, product definition, positioning, promotions, pricing, and target marketing. Like most hotels, hotel H , a hotel located in Lisbon, Portugal, member of the independent hotel chain C, uses a hospitality standard market segmentation based on the origin of the customer. However, A, the new marketing manager of hotel H, recognized that this type of segmentation, as is today well-known, is not useful for the hotel marketing department.</p>
